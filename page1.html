		<b>Do conversations in your house normally sound like this:</b>

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
You: We are going to visit relatives this week.
<br>
<br>
Kid/Teen: Mmmmm.(Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap)
<br>
<br>
You: Make sure you finish your studies.
<br>
<br>
Kid/Teen: Mmmmm.(Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap)
<br>
<br>
You: Are you even listening to......
<br>
<br>
Kid/Teen (Looking Horrified): That person said what about me! (Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap)

<b>Or, does your child/teen play lots of games,
	<br>
Can't leave a device,
<br>
Can't live without a device?</b>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Then your child/teen may have digital addiction</u></b>

<div id="addicts">
	These young addicts include 3-year-olds who scream when they can't have their tablets, middle-schoolers whose grades nosedive because they can't quit texting or posting on Facebook, and high-schoolers who compulsively play online games.

	<u><b>It makes people think: Digital Addiction is becoming a big problem!</b></u>
	<br>
	<br>

	Digital Addiction's effect is metabolic syndrome, the first step to diabetes!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<b>Signs that may show that your child has digital addiction are:</b>

	<button onclick="addiction1()">Click here for sign 1!</button>

	<p id="sign1"></p>
	<br>
	<button onclick="addiction2()">Click here for sign 2!</button>

	<p id="sign2"></p>
	<br>
	<button onclick="addiction3()">Click here for sign 3!</button>

	<p id="sign3"></p>
	<br>
	<button onclick="addiction4()">Click here for sign 4!</button>

	<p id="sign4"></p>
	<br>
	<button onclick="addiction5()">Click here for sign 5!</button>

	<p id="sign5"></p>
	<br>
	
	<b>If you said yes to any of those questions, you might want to have some ideas:</b> 

<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Write up a schedule specifying how much screen time your child can have each day and give consequences for breaking the rules.
<br>
2. Make a rule that during homework time, at dinner, and one hour  before bedtime, all electronic devices get shut off. That means yours, too.
<br>
3. Use parental controls to limit your child's cell phone, TV, computer time, and other electronics.
<br>
4. Find out what's going on in your child's life. Kids who are stressed or depressed are more likely to develop a screen addiction.
<br> 
5. Tell your child to spend at least one hour each day playing outside. 
<br>
6. Get your child involved in volunteer work, sports or other community activities.
<br>
<br>

<b>You should set a good example for your child and follow these rules.</b>
