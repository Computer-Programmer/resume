1. <b>Put electronic devices away.</b> Leave your phone in the other room when you are doing your homework or cooking, or whatever you are busy with.
<br>
<br>
2. <b>Have no electronics until a certain time.</b> Make a hard and fast rule that you will not pick up your phone or your computer until a certain time.
<br>
<br>
3. <b>Remove applications.</b> Log out of, or uninstall, most applications you may have active on your phone.
<br>
<br>
4. <b>When you need to walk somewhere, experiment with leaving your headphones in your pocket-</b> Decide not to listen to music or podcasts. Don't look at your phone. Enjoy the simplicity of walking without distractions.
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Put your phone on airplane mode the night before.</b> That way, if you need to briefly use your phone (to check the time or the weather or something), you won't get hit with a billion notifications.
<br>
<br>
<b>6. Refrain from putting TV and electronic gadgets</b> in your child's bedroom, and put away such devices after use.
<br>
<br>
<b>7. Observe tech-free times</b> such as during meals, homework and bedtime. In addition, you can designate tech-free zones for your child such as in the bedroom, dining area and in the car.
<br>
<br>
<b>8. Challenge yourself to read</b> at least 30 pages of a great book before you check your computer or mobile device. Pick the right reading material and you will soon find you have created a new pastime! 
<br>
<br>
<b>9. Skip the morning digital check-in.-</b> Waking up to a techie breakfast of checking your email, Facebook or Instagram likes that you scored since midnight isn't that nourishing. It saps productivity by flooding the mind with a full plate of everything before you've had a chance to focus on the bigger picture.
